This project implements a Transformer model based on the "Attention Is All You Need" paper for a translation task using the European Parliament Proceedings Parallel Corpus. Here's a summary of each stage:

### Stage 1: Importing Dependencies
- **Purpose**: To set up the necessary libraries and modules.
- **Actions**: 
  - Import Python libraries such as NumPy, TensorFlow, and TensorFlow Datasets.
  - Install TensorFlow and TensorFlow Datasets if needed.

### Stage 2: Data Preprocessing
- **Loading Files**:
  - Import text files containing parallel corpora in English and Spanish, as well as non-breaking prefixes.
  
- **Cleaning Data**:
  - Process the corpora to manage punctuation and spacing issues.
  - Replace and remove certain punctuations and clean multiple spaces.
  
- **Tokenizing Text**:
  - Convert text into numerical tokens using `SubwordTextEncoder` from TensorFlow Datasets.
  - Define vocabulary size and encode sentences.
  
- **Removing Long Sentences**:
  - Filter out sentences longer than a specified maximum length to ensure uniformity in training data.
  
- **Inputs/Outputs Creation**:
  - Pad sequences to a uniform length and create TensorFlow datasets for model training.
  - Prepare the data for batching and prefetching to optimize performance.

### Stage 3: Model Building
- **Positional Encoding**:
  - Implement a layer to encode the positions of tokens in the sequence using sine and cosine functions.

- **Attention Mechanism**:
  - Implement scaled dot-product attention and multi-head attention layers.
  - Multi-head attention splits inputs into multiple projections to capture different aspects of relationships between tokens.

- **Encoder**:
  - Construct the encoder with layers of multi-head attention and feed-forward networks, incorporating positional encoding and dropout for regularization.

- **Decoder**:
  - Build the decoder with similar layers to the encoder but with additional attention to the encoder's outputs.
  - Handle masking to manage padding and look-ahead within sequences.

- **Transformer Model**:
  - Combine the encoder and decoder into a complete Transformer model.
  - Implement methods to create padding and look-ahead masks to manage sequence lengths and prevent future token peeking during training.

This setup provides a robust framework for machine translation, leveraging the Transformer architecture to handle sequential data effectively.

In this project, the tools and technical solutions used are:

### Tools
1. **Python**: Programming language used for implementing the project.
2. **TensorFlow**: Open-source deep learning framework for building and training the Transformer model.
3. **TensorFlow Datasets (TFDS)**: Library used to handle and preprocess text data.
4. **NumPy**: Library for numerical operations and array manipulations.
5. **Jupyter Notebook**: Development environment for writing and executing Python code.

### Technical Solutions
1. **Transformer Architecture**:
   - **Positional Encoding**: Adds positional information to input embeddings to capture the order of tokens.
   - **Multi-Head Attention**: Allows the model to focus on different parts of the input sequence simultaneously.
   - **Scaled Dot-Product Attention**: Computes attention scores by scaling dot products of queries and keys.
   - **Encoder-Decoder Structure**: Uses an encoder to process the input sequence and a decoder to generate the output sequence.

2. **Data Preprocessing**:
   - **Text Tokenization**: Converts words into numerical tokens using `SubwordTextEncoder` to handle vocabulary and improve model performance.
   - **Data Cleaning**: Removes unnecessary characters, handles non-breaking prefixes, and tokenizes the text.
   - **Padding and Truncation**: Ensures all sequences have the same length for batch processing.

3. **Model Training**:
   - **Dataset Preparation**: Uses TensorFlow's `tf.data.Dataset` for efficient batching, shuffling, and prefetching of data.
   - **Training Configuration**: Implements training with dropout for regularization and masks to handle padding and future tokens.

4. **Masking**:
   - **Padding Mask**: Prevents the model from attending to padding tokens.
   - **Look-Ahead Mask**: Ensures that the decoder does not attend to future tokens during training.

## Here are some real-world applications of the NLP Transformer project that we can apply:

1. **Machine Translation**:
   - **Automatic Translation**: Transformers enable effective translation between languages, powering tools like Google Translate and DeepL.

2. **Text Generation**:
   - **Content Creation**: They can generate high-quality text for articles, stories, or marketing content.
   - **Question Answering**: Transformers drive systems that answer questions based on text or documents, such as automated customer support systems.

3. **Text Summarization**:
   - **Document Summarization**: Transformers can distill long documents or articles into concise, understandable summaries.

4. **Sentiment Analysis**:
   - **Opinion Analysis**: They can assess customer reviews or social media posts to determine the sentiment or emotional tone of the content.

5. **Recommendation Systems**:
   - **Personalized Recommendations**: Transformers can build systems that suggest products or content based on user preferences and behavior.

6. **Text Classification**:
   - **Document or Email Categorization**: They can classify documents or emails into different categories, such as filtering spam or organizing content.

7. **Information Retrieval**:
   - **Enhanced Search**: Transformers improve search engines by providing more relevant results based on the context and intent of queries.

These applications showcase the versatility and impact of Transformers in various fields, enhancing user experiences and operational efficiency across industries.
